# HatTournamentSystem
A system for organizing tournaments for the game "Hat".

This application will allow you to automate the process of preparing and organizing tournaments for the game "Hat".

It is planned to support the following functionality: 
  * Work with a word bank (adding / removing / taking words of a certain complexity)
  * Work with a list of participants
  * Creating tournament rounds
  * Splitting round participants by games
  * Processing protocols of game results
  * Determining who succeeded to move to the next round
  * Creating and filling templates for protocols

It is planned to implement the server part with an API to support the deployment of the application in the local network. 
It is also planned to implement different client options for convenient work with the system on the network, without the need to have direct access to the computer on which the system is deployed.
